1. The topographic wetness index (TWI), also known as the compound topographic index (CTI), is a steady state wetness index. It is commonly used to quantify topographic control on hydrological processes.[1] The index is a function of both the slope and the upstream contributing area per unit width orthogonal to the flow direction (wikipedia.org

2. Areas prone to water accumulation (large contributing drainage areas) and characterized by low slope angle will be linked to high TWI values. On the other hand, well-drained dry areas (steep slopes) are associated to low TWI values.
